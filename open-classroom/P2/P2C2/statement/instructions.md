# Context

You are required to write a program that calculates various statistics for a set of numbers provided by the user.

# Instructions

1. Ask the user to **enter** (`input()`) a list of integers separated by commas (e.g., `1,2,3,4`). Then, use the `split()` function to create a list with all the numbers and **display** this list.
    * The `split()` function is used to split a string into multiple parts based on a specified delimiter, and it returns an array containing the separated parts.

2. **Calculate** and **display** the sum of the numbers in the list. Use a `for` loop.
    * For example: `Sum of numbers: 10`

3. **Calculate** and **display** the average of the numbers in the list.
    * For example: `Average of numbers: 2.5`

4. **Calculate** and **display** the number of integers in the list that are greater than the average. Use a `for` loop.
    * For example: `Number of numbers greater than the average: 2`

5. **Calculate** and **display** the number of integers in the list that are even. Use a `while` loop.
    * For example: `Number of even numbers: 2`

**Attention**: In this exercise, write your code in the part located below the line `def main()`. **Make sure to indent everything by one level** so that your code works correctly. We wrapped your code in what we call a function, to test your code we had to nest your code in this function.
